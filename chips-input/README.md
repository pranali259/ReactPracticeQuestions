Explanation of Features and Important Points in the Code:

1. Input Field:

type="text" is set on the input element.
inputValue state holds the current value of the input field.
handleInputChange updates inputValue as the user types.

2. Add Chips:

handleKeyDown listens for the Enter key.
e.preventDefault() stops the default form submission (which would refresh the page).
inputValue.trim() removes leading/trailing whitespace.
A conditional check ensures that the chip is not empty (trimmedInput) and not already present in the chips array (!chips.includes(trimmedInput)).
setChips([...chips, trimmedInput]) adds the new chip. The spread operator (...chips) creates a new array, ensuring immutability, which is good practice in React.
setInputValue('') clears the input field.

3. Remove Chips:

handleRemoveChip function is called when the "X" button next to a chip is clicked.
chips.filter((chip) => chip !== chipToRemove) creates a new array that excludes the chip that was clicked. This correctly handles deleting only one instance even if there are duplicates with the same name.

4. Horizontal Display:

The chips array is mapped over using chips.map(...) to render each chip as a div.
display: flex and flex-wrap: wrap in the .chips-display CSS ensure that the chips are laid out horizontally and wrap to the next line if space runs out.
gap property in CSS provides spacing between the chips.

5. Persistence:

useState([]) initializes chips as an empty array.
useEffect for Loading: The first useEffect with an empty dependency array [] runs only once when the component mounts. It attempts to load chips from localStorage.
useEffect for Saving: The second useEffect with [chips] as its dependency array runs whenever the chips state changes. It saves the current chips array to localStorage using JSON.stringify().
Error handling is included for localStorage operations.

****************************************
Important Points:

Input field type: type="text" is specified.
Button label: The button uses "X" for deletion.
Deleting duplicates: The filter method used in handleRemoveChip ensures that only the specific clicked chip is removed. If you had an array like ['apple', 'banana', 'apple'] and clicked "X" on the first 'apple', only that one would be removed. The current implementation (filtering by value) would remove all chips with the same value. If you strictly need to remove only one specific instance when duplicates exist, you would need to store chips as objects with unique IDs, e.g., [{ id: 1, name: 'apple' }, { id: 2, name: 'banana' }, { id: 3, name: 'apple' }]. My current solution removes all chips with the same name, which is often the desired behavior for tags/keywords. If you need the former, let me know, and I can adjust it.
onKeyDown vs. onKeyPress: onKeyDown={handleKeyDown} is used as requested.

This solution provides a robust and well-structured React component for your "Chips Input" task!
